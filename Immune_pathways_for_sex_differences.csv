Stat-1 signaling (Inflammatory markers),ISG15,"Interferon-stimulated gene 15/ubiquitin cross-reacting protein (designated ISG15/UCRP) is a 15-kDa ubiquitin-like protein identified as a product of an IFN-stimulated gene in humans (11). ISG15-homologous genes were found in several other species but are absent in yeast (26). ISG15 expression is induced in many cell types by IFNs, viral infection, bacterial endotoxins, double-stranded RNA, and genotoxic stress.
